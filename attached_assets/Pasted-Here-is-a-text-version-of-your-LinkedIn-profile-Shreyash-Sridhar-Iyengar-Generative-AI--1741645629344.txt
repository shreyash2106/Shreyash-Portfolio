### **Summary**  
Currently immersed in AI-driven robotics at Purdue University, focusing on leveraging language models and diffusion models for robotic-agent planning. With a foundation in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences (EECS) and Data Science from UC Berkeley, I am currently completing my Master's degree in Computer Science, with a planned graduation in May 2025.  
My experience at Amazon Web Services as a Machine Learning Engineering Intern allowed me to develop **AutoGluon-RAG**, an open-source Python package for users to obtain an end-to-end RAG pipeline in three lines of code.  
Skilled in Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Python, Golang, Data Science, and Full-Stack software.
